# BlackJack_Game
The Python code in this repository is a text-based version of the Blackjack game. It includes functions for card distribution, scoring, and gameplay. The `play_game` function manages the player's and computer's hands, allowing the player to draw cards or pass until reaching 21, going over, or choosing to pass. The computer then draws cards strategically. The main loop enables multiple rounds, prompting the user to play again ('y') or exit ('n'). The game displays the final hands, scores, and declares a winner based on Blackjack rules, offering a simple and interactive console-based Blackjack experience.
